ðŸ“ŒGEMPAD GENERAL INFORMATION & SERVICE FEES\n
ðŸ‘‰ There are no terms from our side since our launchpad is decentralised.\n
You have the full control over the sale and everything runs through the smart contracts on our part. âœ…\n
You are the one to list a sale, you choose a date when the sale starts and when it ends, the softcap (minimum amount to raise in order for the sale to be successful) hardcap (maximum you can raise; you can also have a sale without the hardcap and you just raise as much as you raise until the sale is live), price of the tokens and all the other details.\n
You will also be the one to receive the funds once the sale ends directly on your wallet as we never get that money ourselves so it's all automatic âœ…`,
